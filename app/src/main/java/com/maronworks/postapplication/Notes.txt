    - error in saving file and reading file

2024-03-04      9:20AM
I am planning to create just one table for post, for better reading posts,
since it is only located on one table. Editing it is easy too, just:
    Select * from [$TABLE_NAME] where [$USERNAME_COL] = 'username';

I am trying to save the current user logged in to a file and read it later.

When the user clicked Register on Login
    - create another table with the name of user
        [ex. ralph_table -> values (user_created, label(content), date_posted]
