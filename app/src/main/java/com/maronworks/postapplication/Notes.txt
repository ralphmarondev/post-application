    - [TODO] implement editing and deleting post

    - error in saving file and reading file [deprecated]
    - we use the database instead of file for saving the current user

    - I am planning to create just one table for post, for better reading posts,
        since it is only located on one table. Editing it is easy too, just:
            Select * from [$TABLE_NAME] where [$USERNAME_COL] = 'username';
    - [done]

    - I am trying to save the current user logged in to a file and read it later. [deprecated]
    - we use database instead.

When the user clicked Register on Login
    - create another table with the name of user [deprecated]
        [ex. ralph_table -> values (user_created, label(content), date_posted]
